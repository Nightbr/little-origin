# Little Origin: Design & Branding Guidelines

## 1. Our Philosophy & Vision

**Little Origin** is more than just an app; it's a calm, joyful space for one of life's most exciting decisions. Our brand identity reflects this.

The design should feel **nurturing, organic, and serene**. It is inspired by the idea of a new seed—the beginning of a new life and a new story. The experience should be as stress-free and pleasant as a walk in a quiet garden.

**Keywords:**

- Warm & Nurturing
- Calm & Serene
- Organic & Natural
- Clean & Simple
- Trustworthy & Secure

## 2. Logo & Iconography

While the final logo will be a community contribution, it should adhere to the following principles:

- **Concept:** The logo should visually represent "new beginnings" and "connection." A simple icon combining a **sprout/seedling** with a symbol of connection (like two overlapping leaves, a speech bubble, or a heart shape) is ideal.
- **Style:** Minimalist, clean lines, and soft, rounded shapes. Avoid sharp edges or complex details.
- **Usage:** The logo should be versatile and work well in a single color (our `Charcoal` or `Sage Green`) and as a small app icon.

**App Icon:**
The app icon should be simple and instantly recognizable. A single sprout icon on a `Calm Ivory` or `Sage Green` background would be a strong choice.

## 3. Color Palette: "The Seedling"

Our palette is earthy, gentle, and warm. It provides enough contrast to be highly accessible while remaining soft and easy on the eyes.

### Primary Colors

- **Calm Ivory**
  - **HEX:** `#F5F5F0`
  - **Usage:** The primary background color for all screens. It's the canvas for our app, creating a bright, airy, and natural feel.

- **Sage Green**
  - **HEX:** `#A8B8A0`
  - **Usage:** The main secondary color. Use for UI elements like navigation bars, card borders, inactive tabs, progress indicators, and secondary buttons. It’s the color of calm support.

### Accent & Text Colors

- **Warm Clay**
  - **HEX:** `#D88C74`
  - **Usage:** The primary accent and call-to-action (CTA) color. Use for **"Like" buttons**, primary action buttons ("Create Circle"), match notifications, and any element that needs to draw positive attention. It represents warmth, agreement, and celebration. **Use it thoughtfully, not everywhere.**

- **Charcoal**
  - **HEX:** `#3D403D`
  - **Usage:** The primary color for all text and important icons. This soft black provides excellent readability against `Calm Ivory` without the harshness of `#000000`, maintaining the overall gentle aesthetic.

## 4. Typography

Our typography is chosen to be friendly, highly readable, and accessible, reinforcing our brand's warm personality. Both fonts are open-source and available on Google Fonts.

### Primary Typeface (Headings & Titles)

- **Font:** **Nunito**
- **Why:** Its rounded letterforms feel friendly, gentle, and approachable. It's perfect for titles and short, impactful text.
- **Weights:** Use **Bold** (700) for main headings and **Semi-Bold** (600) for sub-headings.

### Secondary Typeface (Body & UI Text)

- **Font:** **Lato**
- **Why:** It's an exceptionally clear and readable sans-serif that feels transparent and honest. Its semi-rounded details convey warmth, making it a perfect partner for Nunito.
- **Weights:** Use **Regular** (400) for all body copy and UI text. Use **Italic** (400) for captions or quotes.

### Typographic Hierarchy

- **H1 (Screen Title):** Nunito Bold, 28px
- **H2 (Section Header):** Nunito Bold, 22px
- **H3 (Card Title / Name):** Nunito Semi-Bold, 20px
- **Body Text:** Lato Regular, 16px
- **Button Text:** Nunito Semi-Bold, 16px
- **Captions / Helper Text:** Lato Regular, 14px

## 5. UI Elements & Components

Consistency is key. Here’s how to apply the brand system to common UI elements.

- **Buttons:**
  - **Primary CTA Button:** `Warm Clay` background, white (`#FFFFFF`) text.
  - **Secondary Button:** `Sage Green` outline (2px border), `Sage Green` text, transparent background.
  - **Tertiary/Text Button:** Text only, using `Sage Green` color.

- **Cards (for names):**
  - **Background:** `Calm Ivory`.
  - **Border:** A subtle 1px border in a slightly darker shade of our Ivory, or a `Sage Green` top border (3px) for a touch of color.
  - **Shadow:** Use soft, diffused shadows to lift cards off the background, not dark, hard ones.

- **Input Fields:**
  - **Default State:** `Calm Ivory` background with a light gray border.
  - **Active State:** The border color changes to `Sage Green`.
  - **Text:** All input text should be `Charcoal`.

- **Icons:**
  - Use a consistent, lightweight line-icon set with rounded corners.
  - **Active Icon (e.g., current tab):** `Sage Green` or `Warm Clay`.
  - **Inactive Icon:** `Charcoal` at 60% opacity.

## 6. Tone of Voice

How we communicate in text is as important as our visuals.

> **Our voice is like a supportive friend: encouraging, clear, and always positive.**

- **Warm & Encouraging:** Use words like "Let's find...", "Congratulations!", "You have a new match!"
- **Simple & Clear:** Avoid jargon. Write short, simple sentences. Instead of "Authenticate," use "Sign In."
- **Celebratory:** A match is a special moment! Celebrate it with joyful microcopy like "It's a Match!" or "You both love this name!"
- **Inclusive:** Use neutral language. Refer to "parents," "family," and "your circle."
